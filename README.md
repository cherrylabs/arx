# ARX : A Reflexive seXy Kit

[ARX](http://www.arx.xxx/) is an elegant, open source, and object oriented HMVC web kit built using PHP5, by a team of volunteers. It aims to be swift, secure, and small.

Released under a [BSD license](http://arx.xxx/license), ARX can be used legally for any open source, commercial, or personal project.

## Documentation
ARX's documentation can be found at <http://arx.xxx/documentation> which also contains an API browser.

The `userguide` module included in all ARX releases also allows you to view the documentation locally. Once the `userguide` module is enabled in the bootstrap, it is accessible from your site via `/index.php/guide` (or just `/guide` if you are rewriting your URLs).
