### Philosophy

The Arxmin package is totally agnostic. It means that everything is separated as a module so you download only that you really needs in your Laravel Project and in Your Admin.

The package consist of some helpers your admin but you are free to manage your User management, Blog and Data management as you want.

Please go to Modules Tab and begin to build or explore something amazing !

### How to create/load a module ?

To create a module, you can run in your terminal : 

```sh
php artisan module:make your_module
```

Then after that you will see a modules/$$your_module$$  folder with a start.php at the begining.

#### How to add your module in the Arxmin ?

To add your module inside the admin interface.

1. You need to register the menu in your start.php file. 

Example :
 
In start.php
 
````php
Arxmin::registerMenu(array(
    'name' => 'Dashboard', # Name of your Dashboard
    'ref' => 'dashboard', # absolute ref of your module
    'type' => 'module', # type of element (by default module)
    'ico' => 'fa-home', # font-awesome icon to use
    'link' => url('/arxmin/modules/dashboard'), # the absolute module path
    'position' => 0, # the wanted position in the Admin
));
````

2. In your controller who handle your link url. You need to extend the Arxmin\ModuleController.

Example : 

````php

use Arxmin\ModuleController;

class DashboardController extends ModuleController {
	public function anyIndex()
	{
		$title = __("Dashboard example");

		$description = __("This dashboard can be customised in /modules/Dashboard");

		return $this->viewMake('dashboard::index', get_defined_vars());
	}
}

````

3. In your view, you need to extend arxmin::layouts.admin.

Example

````html
@extends('arxmin::layouts.admin')

@section('content')
	ENTER YOUR CUSTOM CONTENT
@stop
````
